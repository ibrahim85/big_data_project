After cloning, the Git repository, reproduce results and analyses:

First, download the data by running:
        bash download_data.sh
Also download: github.com/fivethirtyeight/uber-tlc-foil-response/tree/master/uber-trip-data

Install necessary packages by running:
        python geocoder_files/setup.py install

Next, run the location tool by running:
        bash run_geocoder.sh

Make sure all data files from the previous steps are local to your Hadoop cluster. To copy these files to HDFS and run the MapReduce tasks:
        bash run_mapreduce.sh

You should now have three folders in the data directory. Copy these to your local machine by running:
        rsync -avP ./data/AprilSept2014/yellow_buckets/part-00000 yellow_buckets
        rsync -avP ./data/AprilSept2014/green_buckets/part-00000 green_buckets
        rsync -avP ./data/AprilSept2014/uber_buckets/part-00000 uber_buckets

Run the analysis and output tables, coefficients, and plots by running:
        python run_analysis.py
