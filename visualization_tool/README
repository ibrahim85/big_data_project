First make sure to install the Basemap package. The installation is a bit tricky. First install the package from:

http://matplotlib.org/basemap/users/installing.html

Then refer to this Stackoverflow thread for the solution that worked for me:

Make sure the code file is in the same location as the folder entitled NYC, as it contains the shapefiles needed for the drawing.

To run the code, you can either call it from the terminal using:

python draw_trips.py <filename> <latitude_index> <longitude_index>

or you can use it from code by calling the function:

draw(<longitudes_list>,<latitudes_list>)
